Sprite = 16x16 thingy with animation. Up to 20 at once.
- Parent Chunk (flag)
- Pos X (8.8 fixed word) (relative to current chunk)
- Pos Y (8.8 fixed word)
- Tile Base (byte)
- Animation (pointer)

Animation
- List of Frames (duration = 0, terminate / restart animation)

Frame
- Tile Offset (from base) (byte)
- Duration (frames)

UNSURE - this may be too general. We have few enough objects that special case code might
be preferable. Depends on if we invent additional hazards, enemies, things to bounce on,
etc.

Object (Up to 20 per chunk. Up to 40 loaded at once.)
- Sprite (index? pointer?)
- Behavior (pointer)
- Data (general purpose, some fixed amount)

can be strung together next to other chunks, defined by some [magic rules].
