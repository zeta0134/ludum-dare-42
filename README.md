# Dyson's Fear

Something has caused a runaway chain reaction on your space station and now you're running for your life from a massive explosion! There's just one problem - there's only so much space station to run through - but there are intelligent wrenches that can build additional sections of the station laying around. How long can you print the flames without running out of ship and flying into the vastness of space? Don't panic! This is *Dyson's Fear*.

## What is this?

This project is a Gameboy game written for the Ludum Dare 42 game jam. It was written almost entirely from scratch (some library functions were pre-written) in 72 hours.

## How do I get it?

Once we have a release up on GitHub, you can download the ROM from the releases page.
